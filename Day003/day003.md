# day 3

I'm exploring git a bit to see how I can use it better

## Resources
- This blog post [VS Code extensions](https://codeburst.io/vs-code-extensions-that-make-me-fall-love-in-programming-each-day-ccf05b24651e)
- led me to this [oh-my-zsh site](https://ohmyz.sh/#install), which has code to add to your terminal to have all the pretty colors
- I sent my theme to the agnostic theme using documentation from [oh-my-zsh github](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) `ZSH_THEME="agnoster"` apparently you can randomize your theme which may be something I can be into down the line
- And now I have a somewhat pretty terminal.
