- in VScode writing in "!" and tab and getting all of the things for an index.html page

# Learning CSS

# mind blown
- the browser has CSS by default that you need to override
- cascading and overriding!
- Link Pseudo classes have to be in a specific order

:link — unvisited link
:visited — visited state
:focus — the currently "focused" (selected) element
:hover — hover your mouse over this
:active — the time between the link is selected and the time the page loads. (Not used much today.)

- :link, :visited, :active are used almost exclusively on links (the A tag).

- The pseudo-classes :focus and :hover are used with links and with any other element on the page. :focus is especially useful with forms and in accessibility contexts.
