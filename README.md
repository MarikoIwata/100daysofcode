[100 Days of Code Challenge](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) is an initiative I am commiting to take, where I will be spending each day working on problem solving and personal projects to improve my skills and push my boundaries.

I'm going to follow Two Main Rules:
1. Code a minimum of an hour every day for the next 100 days.
2. Tweet your progress every day with the #100DaysOfCode hashtag

My Exceptions:
- If I break the streak, I will make sure that I won't break it the next day
- Sundays are off days

## 100DaysOfCode Day-to-Day Progress

## Day 1

- I figured out how to create this README.md in markdown on VS code 

- RESOURCES
    - in VS Code change all occurances is âŒ˜F2 will hopefully do me wonders
    - [Markdown Cheatsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
    - [Special Thanks to Aswin for this #100daysofcode format](https://aswinbarath.github.io/100-days-of-code-challenge/)
    - my gifs are from [giphy](https://giphy.com/) (you're welcome for that rabbit hole)

- CHALLENGES
    - I mistakenly `git init` from the wrong folder causing all my files to be in the untracked area when I did `git status`. Solved that by clearning everything with `rm -rf ~/.git` 

## Day 2
- Learned how to upload it to github through VS Code.
- details on the git commands I used [here](Day002/Day002.md)

## Day 3
- Learned how to make my terminal a little more pretty and found resources for VS Code Extensions
- details on the git commands I used [here](Day003/Day003.md)

## Day 4
- I set up leetcode on VS Code so I can work out problems there

## Day 5
- today I installed homebrew, check out my folder for resource links on that

## Day 6
- explored a cool tool that allows you to practice and save regex

## Day 7
- Terminal commands I can't live without is in my Day 7 folder and a way for me to get to it when I'm not at my desk where all of my post its are on my wall.
